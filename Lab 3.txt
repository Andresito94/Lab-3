Instructions:
1. Create a new GitHub repository called Lab-3 and then clone it to your local machine.

2. Set up a new Vite project and move all its files (excluding the project folder) to the local repository folder on your machine.

3. Inside the "src" folder, create a new folder named "data" and place the "data.js" file in it to serve as the database of colours.

4. Create a "Components" folder and then create a React component named "ColorBox," which accepts a colour prop. The ColorBox should 
be clickable, and clicking on it should change its colour. Import the "colors" list, defined as an array of hexadecimal strings 
representing colours, from "data.js."

5. The coloured div within the ColorBox component should have a width and height of 50px.

6. Create another React component called "ColorBoxesContainer," containing five divs, with each div housing five ColorBox components 
that receive a colour array as a prop.

7. The end result should be a 5x5 grid of 25 colour boxes that the user can click on to change their colours randomly.

8. Once completed, upload the project to GitHub and share the link with me for assessment.
